## What is Concept-Based Image Retrieval?
Concept-Based Image Retrieval (CBIR) allows the retrieval of images based on what is present in the photo rather than the associated tags that come with the photo, including metadata. The need for a CBIR has increasingly become more important as we move towards a more media driven society where camera-enabled phones are practically everywhere. 

In order to implement a Concept-Based Image Retrieval, the system first and foremost requires to understand images at a high level. This presents two particular problems. Firstly, the intention-gap, a non-technical issue. That is a user intends to search something specific, however it is very broad or has many meanings[1]. A great example of the intention gap iis a user query of ‘ apple’ and in return is presented with Apple Inc. rather than the fruit, or vise-versa (even through an image query). The second problem is the image similarity is very far off the users’ query, this is called the semantic gap. This technical problem is one of the challenging aspects of Content-Based Image Retrieval which are being heavily studied and in this paper 2 models will be discussed.


Ultimately, CBIR allows the retrieval of visual documents using the image itself rather than textual information of the image.

## Applications of CBIR
CBIR can be used for various activities. A really important and fascinating one is tattoo image retrieval. Tattoos are becoming more common today with individuals and thus have become a method for human identification. Tattoo pigments are embedded in the skin to a level that become permanent on some level. Over years, tattoos have helped identify criminals[​ 3]​ - even more so when the tattoos have some hidden meaning that becomes easier to identify when there is a dataset of featured images - and also identified victims of different attacks and disasters such as the 2004 Asian tsunami. Another application are individuals who want to find images that are online without the individuals permission.

## Components of CBIR
- Query Formation

Query formation is a crucial step in image retrieval as it has a significant impact on the results. The most common query type in CBIR is a query by example (QBE), that is providing an image similar to what the user wants to find. Another query type is by sketch, and more types are shown in the image below.

- Image Representation

Image representation is how images will be compared. When analyzing images, the low-level features, such as the colors, shapes become somewhat useless to use directly for comparison with images as visual objects and scenes undergo various transformations​. Shown below is a way of image extraction, different parts of the image are recognized, then converted into an understandable quantitative description.

- Image Indexing

Here is how the images are stored in the database, and specifically how they are organized. This is important as different ways to organize or index can have an impact on how efficient and fast the retrieval is. 

## Conclusion
Concept Based Image Retrieval allows an effective way to access visual data and retrieval of it. A more technical report and details can be found [here](/assets/img/posts/cbir/report.pdf)
