Welcome! I am a Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa with a strong interest in application, cloud and infrastructure <span style="color:red">**security**</span>, vulnerability research, and machine learning.

I am very passionate about what I do, always looking for fun challenges and keep a positive attitude with it's simplicity or complexity. I devote much of my time learning new technologies or keeping up with the latest, and developing something that can truely impact us today. As well love to have fun playing chess, video games or movies.


Of course I'm always looking for new oppertunities, so reach out to me!  ðŸ™‚
