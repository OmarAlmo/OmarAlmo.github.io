Welcome! I am a Computer Science student at the University of Ottawa with a strong interest in network, cloud and infrastructure <span style="color:red">**security**</span>, vulnability reseasch (or hacking...ðŸ˜¬), and machine learning.

I am very passionate about what I do, always looking for fun challenges and keep a positive attitude with it's simplicities and difficulties. I devote much of my time learning whether it be new technologies or keeping up with the latest, and developing something that can truely impact us today.

Of course I'm always looking for new oppertunities, so reach out to me! ðŸ™‚
