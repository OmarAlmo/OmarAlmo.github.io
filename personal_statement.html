        <h1>Hi üôÇ</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>We meet again! I hope you are having a good day so far üôÇ and it was amazing meeting you time and time
            again
            at the various events from your internship open house 2 years ago to CSGames this year (super smash was
            really
            fun!!). Now let me start by the simple meme üòÇ and then lets begin! <br><br>

        <h1>
            <font color="#b40000">About</font> Me
        </h1>
        <p> My name is Omar Almoallim, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the university of Ottawa. I
            started
            university studying Biopharmaceutical Sciences for 2 years before switching to CS. Why you may ask?
            Well simply it was not for me. For as long as I can remember I always enjoyed technology and was very
            fascinated
            by it to the point where I would download an editor and just stare at it and seeing how amazing it was.
            Then it
            finally hit me that <strong>THIS WHAT I WANT TO DO! üë®üèª‚Äçüíª</strong><br><br>
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/1AjVbjH9Xc4yaQCzBV/giphy.gif" class="center"><br>
            Eventhough it took me few months to finally decide, I could not be happier about that decision today.
            With my
            interests and experience growing everyday. I have been very invested to <st>building applications that would
                improve
                our world and would impact people directly</st>, and this has me fired up... literly. Here are a few of
            my
            interests:
            <br><br><img src="https://drive.google.com/uc?export=view&id=12NQWDhMK0aqUXkhK93TjwaIQM8SizlJW"
                class="center" />
            <br>
            Since then I have gone a long way üòÅ. In my first hackathon, my team and I built a web application and at
            the time
            I didn't know what javascript was, didn't know 'server' and 'client' meant, and even what version control or
            git
            was ü•∫! This was the frist glimps of my first real-world program application. Nonetheless, this was a great
            oppertunity
            that I am glad I experienced especially being surrounded with very expereinced and smart individuals.
            <br><br>
            Then fast forward to March 2019...CS Games! This was again one of the best challenges that I attended and
            the again another event where I got exposed to so much from AI algorithms to full scale API development
            where I realized that there is a lot more to learn in this field. Also funny enough got to experience the CS
            culture, where 2 seconds of silence can get a group of over 500 people roaring ü§£.
            <br><br>
            There is a quotes that is worth mentioning by Patrick McKenzie, he says: <br>
            <center>
                <em>"Every great developer you
                    know
                    got there by solving problems they were unqualified to solve until they actually did
                    it."</em>
            </center>
            <br><strong>Today, I am more motivated than ever to build on my experience, use it to make change in the
                world, to share this experince
                with others, and to finally see
                <span class="label bg-purple text-uppercase">Pro</span> under my portfolio. ü§ì </strong>

        </p>

        <h1>
            <font style="color:#b40000">Why</font> Me?
        </h1>
        <p> Ever since I switched into CS everything changed, as if I was let go from cage... yea really. I mean
            science and
            biochemistry is interesting and all but the enviroment and community was simply not right for me. From that
            day
            on,
            persuing what I am <st color="#b40000">passionate </st> about became a million times more fun.
            What's even better, is just how challenging
            things can get which makes it a lot more fun to really go very deep and solve challenges. This is
            when my attidue shifted from this...<br><br>
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OwhrqQmSu36GQ/giphy.gif" class="center"><br>
            to this...
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/d4zHnLjdy48Cc/giphy.gif" class="center"><br><br>
            Throughout the courses since the switch, I realized how much I <st>love a good challenge. </st> This can be
            said from expereince when working on JobZi, it was my first
            android development project and boy it was fun. Then comes my personal project, Lemma, that I invested in to
            <st>learn</st> and follow my passion (as
            clich√© as it might sound).
            <br><br>
            Now my main focus and interest is web app security. I figured in order to be good at breaking apps,
            researching for vulnaribitlies, and CTFs I should know how a web application works from bottom up. Thus, I
            am very motivated to go over and beyond to really learn and understand. I am determined to complete
            tasks and seeing it progress from begining to end only motivates me even more üòú. If I could see into the
            future, I could tell you that the day where I would say this
            <br><br>
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/R58jyn0kwwSpq/giphy.gif" class="center"><br>
            as soon as I see a bug, is sooner than you and I think.
        </p>

        <h1>
            <font style="color:#b40000">Project</font> Lemma
        </h1>
        <p>
            Lemma is my first web application that I started developing early this year. It is a simple idea to share
            your knowledge and experties with another individual, who will in return share their knowledge in an area
            that you are
            interested in. In simple words, it is a <st>skills exchange platform</st>. In more indepth words, it's a
            platform
            that I hope will create a more thriving community with trust.
            <br><br>

        <h1>
            <font color="#b40000">Why</font> Shopify?
        </h1>
        <p>Why not? From the focus on security to the company culture üòçü§©, I find Shopify to be an amazing place
            to grow with. The strong attention Shopify puts in security especially through Hacker1 and the very detailed
            policy only encourages me to further strengthen my pentesting skills. Shopify also encourages an enviroment
            where passion is highly respected that enables you and me to thrive. This is why I want to be part of the
            Shopify community and grow with it as well.
            <br><br>
            Also, a really important aspect of Shopify is it's innovation. Just recently that caught my eyes was the
            retail kit and more specifically the Tap & Chip reader which won best design award. The thought of being
            part of an innovating and very fostering companing is ü§Ø (mind blowing) and is definetly a driving force,
            the fact that I can be part of it's future üòä.
        </p>

        <br><br>
        <h1>Conclusion</h1>
        <p>There are no words that can describe how much this oppertunity means to me, my furutre and also Shopify's
            future.
            I strongly believe I will bring enthusiams and great contribution to Shopify. I hope to hear back from
            you and I also hope the next time I attend a hackathon or step on campus I could proudly show my shopify
            swag
            with the black Shopify sweater! üòé
            <br><br>
            Kind regiards,
            <br>
            Omar</p>
