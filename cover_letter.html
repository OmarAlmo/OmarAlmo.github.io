        <h1>Hi ðŸ™‚</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>We meet again! I hope you are having a good day so far ðŸ™‚ and it was amazing meeting you time and time
            again
            at the various events from your internship open house 2 years ago to CSGames this year (super smash was
            really
            fun!!). Now let me start by the simple meme ðŸ˜‚ and then lets begin! <br><br>

            <font color="#5A848E">About</font> Me
        </h1>
        <p> My name is Omar Almoallim, I am a 3rd year Computer Science student at the university of Ottawa. I
            started
            university studying Biopharmaceutical Sciences for 2 years before switching to CS. Why you may ask?
            Well simply it was not for me. For as long as I can remember I always enjoyed technology and was vert
            fascinated
            by it to the point where I would download an editor and just stare at it and seeing how amazing it was.
            Then it
            finally hit me that THIS IS WHAT I WANT TO DO! <br><br>

            Eventhough it took me few months to finally decide, I could not be happier about that decision today.
            With my
            interest and growing expereince I have been very invested to building applications that would improve
            our world
            and impacting people directly, and this has me fired up... literly.
            <strong>Today, I am more motivated than ever to build on my experience to finally see
                <span class="label bg-purple text-uppercase">Pro</span> under my github portfolio. </strong>

        <h1>
            <font color="#5A848E">Why</font> Me?
        </h1>
        <p> Ever since I switched into CS everything changed, as if I was let go from cage... yea really. I mean
            science and
            biochemistry is interesting and all but the enviroment and community was simply not right. From that day
            on,
            persuing what I am passionate about became a million times more fun. What's even better, is just how
            challenging
            things can get which makes it a whole lot more fun to really go very deep and solve challenges. This is
            when my
            attidue shifted from this...<br><br>
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/OwhrqQmSu36GQ/giphy.gif" class="center"><br>
            to this...
            <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/d4zHnLjdy48Cc/giphy.gif" class="center"><br>
            Now my main focus and interest is web app security. I figured in order to be good at breaking apps, and
            researching for vulnaribitlies I should know how a web application works. Thus, I am very motivated to
            go over and beyond to really learn and understand. I don't give up easily... in other words I'm a long term
            investment to be able to say this...<br><br>
